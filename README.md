# Welcome to the Laravel Training Guide

This guide is designed to help you kick start your abilities with laravel.
This is a list of curated information to help demonstrate certain technologies related to laravel and the stack.


## Laravel

As of Laravel 8 the following  technologies are part of the core stack that you should learn

* [Development Environment](#Development-Environment)

* [Laravel](#Laravel-Training-Material)
* [Livewire & AlpineJS](#Livewire-and-AlpineJS-Training-Material)
* [Jetstream](#Laravel-JetStream-Training-Material)
* [Tailwind](#Tailwind-JetStream-Training-Material)


### Development Environment

There are many different ways and tools to configure a laravel development environment.    I have a recipe on how to install and configure laravel.    You can can follow it or not, however __if you don't use the development environment provided YOU!! are responible for diagnoising any and all related issues.__    While this may seem harse, I don't have the time to diagnose every development environment on the planet.   

Please read the following instruction on the Approved [Laravel Develpment Environment](laravel-6-from-scratch.md)


### Laravel Training Material

By far the best resource beside reading the document is laracasts.com.  It contains a vast amount of content, much of which is free.    While I must admit that some of the content hasn't been kept up as well as I would like.  It's free.....

If I were knew to Laravel and want to get up to speed as fast as possible I would do look at the follwong from Laracasts.  I have provided guides on what episodes are important and still relevant.

#### Laravel 6 From Scratch Series 

This series goes over the entire Laravel functionality as of version 6.0.   Many things have changed, but much are still relatively the same.   The following page [Laravel 6 from scratch series ](laravel/laravel-6-from-scratch.md) goes over the relevant episodes that you should watch.

#### Whats new in Laravel Laravel 8 

This series goes over the changes introduced in Laravel 8.   Not all of the episodes are relavent.   Some discuss how to maintain production servers or collapsing migrations.   This are issues which are relvant to existing systems, not brand new projects.   The following page [Whats new in Laravel 8 ](laravel/laravel-6-from-scratch.md) lists the relevant episodes and what to skip and why.


### Livewire and AlpineJS Training Material

The most comprehensive guid that I can find so far is from the creators content on their maing website laravel-livewire.com .   The first two sections are free.   I do have most of the restricted content as I am a contributor.   I may make that content available

    https://laravel-livewire.com/screencasts


### Laravel JetStream Training Material

Laravel Jetstream is prepackage base application which consists of a prebuilt components.   It contains a number of features out of the box.
* Authentication System with prebuilt UI
* Scaffolding templates for building screens

Unfortunately there is not a tonne of material that I have been able to find.  The most comprehensive guide that I can find so far is from the main website https://jetstream.laravel.com.  They have no video based content you really need to just read the documentation.  If you are looking for videos to watch, try these.
They briefly cover Jetstream

* [Laravel Authentication Options](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-authentication-options)


### Tailwind Training Material

Tailwind is the replacement to bootstrap in laravel.  I am not a front end guy.  Up till now I have used prebuilt ui templates.   For example the Inspina Response Admin Template  https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-template-WB0R5L90S

Unless your project is significantly front end heavy not a lot of time is required here.   Most of you will just use the default skins which are supplied with Laravel and Jetstream.   

I would just look around youtube for tutorals.
For example:
