# Laravel From Scratch Series 

The following link takes you to the full series which is free.   https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch.   This series was built on Laravel 6 which is two full releases back.   However almost all of the material from version 6.0 is still relevant in version 8.0.   There has been some changes, but for the most part the methods from version 6 still apply.   Here is an episode guide with my thoughts

### WARNING
  Controllers are still a valid design option  Laravel 8.   However Livewire is now another way to implement Controller type logic.   I have provided a list of recommended episodes to review.   
  
  If the episode is not listed I suggest you skip it.  This is either due to the fact that it is not relevant anymore or the fact that livewire is significantly different.
